# Pulse — Open Source After Effects Alternative

Professional motion-graphics, VFX & compositing app in Rust, and **app #3 of the Prism suite** (sibling
to [Pigment](https://github.com/KwaminaWhyte/prism-suite-pigment) raster, [Contour](https://github.com/KwaminaWhyte/prism-suite-contour) vector). **Goal: reach ≥85% of Adobe After
Effects' real-world capability** — features, reliability, and ease-of-use — in staged milestones, on the
suite's shared engine: `prism-core` (layers, blend math, render graph), `prism-color` (linear/OCIO),
and a shared `prism-fx` (OpenFX-style effects) and `prism-media` (FFmpeg) layer.

> Companion docs: [RESEARCH.md](./RESEARCH.md) (cited findings + crate matrix), [SUITE.md](https://github.com/KwaminaWhyte/prism-suite-prism/blob/main/SUITE.md) (four-app vision + interop). The repo README (when added) tracks what runs *today*; this PLAN is the parity roadmap.

---

## 0. Why this can work

- The hard parts are solved and free: a tile/render-graph compositor (shared with Pigment), blend math
  and color science (`prism-core`/`prism-color`), keyframe interpolation + Bézier easing, OpenColorIO/
  OpenEXR (ASWF Rust bindings), FFmpeg decode/encode, an embeddable expression engine (`rhai`/`rune`).
- After Effects is, at its core, **a keyframed, effect-driven layer compositor**. The compositor is the
  *same* render graph Pigment already runs — Pulse adds **time** (keyframes, expressions), **effects at
  scale** (`prism-fx`), and **media** (`prism-media`). That shared engine is the suite's whole bet.
- AE's real moat is interop + the effect/expression ecosystem + reliability (caching, multi-frame
  render). We target those deliberately.

**Non-negotiable principle:** a **time-addressable render graph** — every layer/effect/property is a
function of time `t`, composited in **linear light** (`prism-color`), cached per (node, frame, tile).
Float (16/32-bit) working buffers from day one; OCIO-managed color; never bake until render.

---

## 0a. Suite boundaries — what belongs in Pulse vs Pigment / Contour / Reel

Pulse shares `prism-core` (already a dependency) and will share `prism-color` / `prism-fx` /
`prism-media`. Every feature is filed against three rules so we never overwrite a sibling app's work:

- **Pulse-owned (motion / VFX / compositing):** comps & precomps, the timeline, keyframes & graph
  editor, expressions, layer types (solid/text/shape/footage/adjustment/null/camera/light), masks &
  roto, track mattes, motion blur, time remapping, 2D/3D compositing, the render queue. Lives in
  `pulse-app` or motion-only modules.
- **Shared-crate, app-agnostic:** the compositor/render-graph, tile model, **blend modes** (reuse
  `prism-core`'s 18), **adjustments** (reuse `prism-core::adjust` for color-correction effects), color
  transforms (`prism-color` + OCIO), the **`prism-fx`** OpenFX host, and **`prism-media`** (FFmpeg
  decode/encode + audio, shared with the future Reel). These **must not** assume Pulse — additions are
  additive and time-agnostic (time is Pulse's layer on top).
- **Out of scope — a sibling app's domain (do not build here):**
  - *A clip-based, multi-track non-linear **video editor*** (trim/ripple/insert clips, transitions
    between clips, full audio mixer) → **Reel** (the Premiere analog). Pulse's timeline is *layer +
    keyframe* based, not clip-based. Pulse renders comps that Reel places via Dynamic Link.
  - *Primary raster painting / photo retouch* → **Pigment**; *deep vector authoring* → **Contour**.
    Pulse has shape layers and text animators (motion-native), and it *consumes* Pigment docs and
    Contour artboards as footage/smart layers via suite interop — it does not re-implement them.
  - *Cross-app interop glue* (Dynamic Link host, `prism-doc` container, shared clipboard/asset library)
    is **suite-level**. Pulse is the canonical Dynamic-Link *producer* (its comps drop live into Reel),
    but the mechanism is defined with the suite, not unilaterally.

---

## 1. Current state (what runs today)

Grounded in `pulse/crates/pulse-app/src/`. An early but real motion scaffold:

- **Comp model** (`comp.rs`) — `Comp { width, height, duration, fps, layers }`; `PulseLayer { name,
  color, visible, + 5 Tracks }`. Five animatable properties: **X, Y, Scale, Rotation, Opacity**, each a
  `Track` of `Keyframe { t, value }`. Sampling = **linear interpolation** between bracketing keys,
  constant hold outside the range; `set_key` inserts/overwrites keeping keys sorted. serde JSON.
- **Transport** (`app.rs`) — playhead `time`, play/pause (Spacebar), real-`dt` advance, loop at
  duration; add/delete/move/recolor layers; save `.pulse` (serde + `rfd`); Export is a **stub**.
- **Timeline** (`timeline.rs`) — time ruler, one lane per layer with **keyframe diamonds**, draggable
  **playhead**, click/drag scrub.
- **Preview** (`preview.rs`) — CPU egui-`Painter` render: each visible layer is a **solid color rect**,
  transformed by sampled (x, y), uniform scale, rotation about center, faded by opacity; fitted to the
  panel.
- **Shell** — `theme.rs` Prism dark theme, `icons.rs` phosphor glyphs; depends on `prism-core`.

**Reality check:** layers are solid swatches; interpolation is linear-only; preview is CPU/egui (no GPU
compositor, no effects, no media, no blend modes yet). Everything below builds from this seed.

## 2. Validated tech stack (verify with `cargo add` at build)

| Concern | Crate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Compositor / render graph | `prism-core` + wgpu (shared w/ Pigment) | Tile model, dirty eval, **18 blend modes**, adjustments. Add the time axis. |
| Color / linear / OCIO | `prism-color` + OpenColorIO (ASWF Rust binding) | Linear-light compositing; OCIO config-driven looks; 8/16/32-bpc. |
| HDR / EXR frames | `exr` 1.74 (+ ASWF OpenEXR Rust binding) | Read/write EXR sequences (f16/f32, multi-layer, deep). |
| Effects host | `prism-fx` (OpenFX-style, suite-shared) | Blur/color/distort/generate/keying authored once, run suite-wide. |
| Media (decode/encode/audio) | `prism-media` → `ffmpeg-next`/`rsmpeg` (or `oximedia`) | Import video/audio/image-seq; export MP4/MOV/ProRes; shared with Reel. |
| Keyframe easing | `kurbo` (Bézier) + `keyframe`/`bezier_easing` | Temporal Bézier ease, hold/linear/auto-Bézier; spatial motion paths via `kurbo`. |
| Expressions | `rhai` (default) / `rune` | Sandboxed per-property expression engine; `wiggle/time/loopOut`-style API. |
| Text / type | `cosmic-text` + `swash`/`harfrust` | Text layers, per-char layout for animators, OpenType + variable fonts. |
| Vector (shape layers / masks) | `kurbo` + `lyon` + `i_overlay` (→ shared `prism-vector`) | Mask paths, shape-layer paths, trim/repeater; same primitives as Contour. |
| AI (roto / matting) | `ort` (shared `pigment-ai`) | Roto Brush via SAM2/3 + matting; feature-gated, models on demand. |
| Undo / project | `undo`/custom + `serde` | Command stack over the comp/graph; `.pulse` project IO. |
| Util | `glam`, `bytemuck`, `rayon` | Math, GPU casts, multi-frame parallel render. |

### Core data model (target)
- **Property<T>** — the atom: a value that is a function of time, defined by **keyframes** (with temporal
  + spatial interpolation) **or** an **expression** (evaluated per frame). Generalize today's `Track`
  (linear-only `f32`) into typed properties (scalar/2D/3D/color/path) with selectable interpolation.
- **Layer** — a typed source (solid/text/shape/footage/adjustment/null/camera/light/**precomp**) + a
  Transform group (anchor, position [2D/3D, separable], scale, rotation/orientation, opacity) + an
  ordered **effect stack** + **masks** + a **track-matte** ref + blend mode + motion-blur/3D flags.
- **Comp** — sized/timed canvas + layer stack + camera/lights; nestable (a comp is a valid layer
  source = **precomp**). The render graph evaluates `comp(t)` → tiles, cached per (node, frame, tile).

## 4. Phased backlog (toward ≥85% parity)

Effort tags **S/M/L**. "shared?" = touches/promotes a `prism-*` crate → keep app-agnostic & time-free.

- [ ] **Presets / animation presets** (S): save an effect+keyframe stack as a named preset
- [ ] Tests: golden-frame per effect; keyer matte quality; noise determinism (seeded)

### Phase 4 — Motion, time & expressions  *(makes it move like AE)*

- [ ] **Frame blending** (S): frame-mix + pixel-motion (optical-flow later)
- [ ] **Time remapping** (M): remap a layer's time via a `Property`; **time stretch**, reverse, freeze-frame
- [ ] **Spatial motion paths** (M): position keys draw an editable Bézier path; auto-orient along path; roving in time
- [ ] **Expressions** (L): per-property `rhai`/`rune` engine; the AE staples — `wiggle`, `time`, `value`, `loopOut/In`, `linear/ease`, `random/seedRandom`, `valueAtTime`, `thisComp/thisLayer`, **pick-whip property links**; expression error surfacing + enable/disable
- [ ] **Markers** (S): comp + layer markers, work-area, time navigation

- [ ] Tests: camera projection, light/shadow correctness, z-sort

### Phase 6 — Media IO, render queue, audio  *(opens/exports everything)*
- [ ] **Import** (M, shared `prism-media`): video (H.264/H.265/ProRes/VP9/AV1), image sequences (PNG/JPEG/**EXR**/DPX/TIFF), audio (WAV/AAC/MP3), still images, SVG (→ shape layers), `.pigment`/`.contour` (via Dynamic Link)

## UI/UX & workspace

What a pro motion app's shell needs that we lack today (fixed four-panel layout, dark
theme, no docking). Phase-8 "Preferences / shortcuts / workspaces" tracks the deep cut;
this section is the concrete, near-term shell work. (Scroll + collapsible Properties
sections landed first — the rest below is unchecked.)

- [ ] **Scrollable panel bodies** — every long panel (Properties, Layers, Timeline lanes) wraps its body in a `ScrollArea` so content never overflows the window. *(done: Properties / Layers / Timeline)*
- [ ] **Collapsible Properties sections** — Transform / Effects / Spatial / Masks / Matte / Text / Shape each its own `CollapsingHeader` so users hide what they don't need. *(done — open by default, per-layer state)*
- [ ] **Dockable panels** — drag panels to re-dock / float / resize (egui `Tile`/`dock` or `egui_dock`); replace the hard-coded `SidePanel`/`TopBottomPanel` layout.
- [ ] **Saveable workspaces** — named layouts (Animation / Effects / Paint-style) persisted to prefs; quick-switch; reset-to-default.
- [ ] **Panel show/hide via a Window menu** — toggle each panel's visibility; remember per-workspace.
- [ ] **Tabbed panel groups** — stack panels as tabs in one dock slot (Affinity "Studio" / AE panel groups); drag a tab out to float.
- [ ] **Contextual options strip** — an Affinity-style toolbar row whose controls change with the active tool / selected layer kind.
- [ ] **Timeline panel ergonomics pass** — resizable label/lane columns, horizontal time zoom + scroll, sticky ruler/header, collapse-to-mini, layer search/filter (overlaps Phase-8 Timeline UX but is a focused shell job).
- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts** — a remappable shortcut map for transport, layer ops, panel toggles (AE muscle-memory: `Space`, `[`/`]`, `T`/`P`/`S`/`R`, `U`); a shortcut-help overlay.
- [ ] **Theme toggle** — light / dark (and high-contrast) switch; today `theme.rs` hard-codes one dark theme. Persist the choice.

## UI/UX & workspace — parity gaps (vs AE + Affinity)

Important features still missing after skimming the plan against After Effects and Affinity
(Photo/Designer). One-line note each; not implemented this turn.

- [x] **Per-layer blend mode picker** — **done**: every layer carries a `serde`-defaulted [`BlendMode`] (reusing `prism-core`'s shared 18-mode set); the CPU compositor blends each layer onto the accumulator via a pure-Rust `blend_over` (W3C blend+composite in linear light, mirroring Pigment's `composite.wgsl`). A **Blend** dropdown in Properties (separable + HSL groups) and a non-Normal blend badge in the Layers panel; unit- + integration-tested. *(Preview still approximates as flat source-over; on-canvas blend preview lands with the GPU compositor.)*
- [ ] **Effect search / browser** — a searchable Effects & Presets panel (type to filter, categorized tree, drag-onto-layer) instead of today's flat "Add" menu.
- [ ] **Onion-skinning** — ghost neighboring frames behind the playhead (frames before/after, count + opacity falloff) for hand-keyed timing — standard in motion tooling, absent from the plan.
- [x] **On-canvas transform gizmo** — **done**: drag the selected layer directly in the preview to **move / scale / rotate / re-anchor** it (bounding box, four corner scale handles, a rotation knob, and an anchor-point cross), keying the edited local transform at the playhead. The drag math (`gizmo.rs`) maps the pointer screen→comp→**parent-local** so parented layers drag correctly under a rotated/scaled parent; pure (`GizmoGeom::build` / `hit_test` / `drag`) and unit-tested.
- [ ] **Snapping & smart guides in the preview** — snap to layer edges/centers, comp center, and user guides while dragging (plan only lists *timeline* snapping + static guides).
- [ ] **Color / swatch picker reuse** — a shared eyedropper + recent-swatches across fill/stroke/effect colors (Affinity-style), instead of isolated `color_edit_button`s.
- [ ] **Numeric drag-edit on every value field** — click-drag a label to scrub, double-click to type (AE/Affinity convention) for all sliders, not just the slider track.
- [ ] **Undo / redo** — no command history exists yet; a core requirement for any editor (likely a shared `prism-core` edit-stack), gating real editing ergonomics.

| **Effects + motion** | 3–4 | + effect stack (`prism-fx`), motion blur, time remap, **expressions** | ~65% |
| **3D + media** | 5–6 | + 3D/camera/lights, media import, render queue/output, audio | **~85%** |
| **Parity+** | 7–8 | + AI/roto, tracking, Dynamic Link, caching/RAM-preview/MFR, autosave/prefs/workspaces | **≥90%** |

**The ≥85% line lands at the end of Phase 6.** Highest felt-parity-per-effort first: **the Phase-1
foundation rebuild (typed properties + Bézier easing + GPU compositor) gates everything** — do it before
breadth. Then footage/masks/precomps (Ph2), then effects + expressions (Ph3–4).

## 6. Hard problems (mitigations)

1. **Foundation debt** → today's linear-only `f32` `Track` and CPU solid-rect preview must become typed `Property<T>` + Bézier easing + the shared GPU render graph **before** piling on features; retrofitting interpolation/compositing later = rewrite. This is Phase 1, deliberately first.
2. **Realtime preview** → AE's RAM-preview model: cache rendered frames (RAM + disk), play the work-area back at frame rate; smart purge on edit; multi-frame rendering across cores fills the cache fast.
3. **Effect sprawl** → one `prism-fx` OpenFX-style pass registry (author once, suite-wide, stack non-destructively) instead of bespoke pipelines; effect params are full `Property<T>`.
4. **Color correctness** → linear-light float compositing through `prism-color`; OpenColorIO config-driven display/output transforms; EXR scene-linear; never bake until render.
5. **Media reliability** → `prism-media` (FFmpeg) shared with Reel; robust footage interpretation (alpha/frame-rate/color), proxies, and relink-missing-footage.
6. **Expressions safety/perf** → sandboxed `rhai`/`rune`; cache compiled expressions; evaluate per frame with cycle/error guards; surface errors without crashing the render.
7. **Shared-crate discipline** → the compositor/blend/adjust/color/fx/media crates stay **time-agnostic**; time (keyframes/expressions) is Pulse's layer on top, so Pigment/Contour/Reel reuse them unchanged.
8. **Scope vs Reel** → Pulse is a *layer+keyframe compositor*, not a clip-based NLE; resist building a multi-track audio mixer / clip-trim timeline — that's Reel, fed by Pulse via Dynamic Link.

## 7. Immediate next steps

1. [~] **Phase 1 foundation** — **Bézier easing** + hold landed (self-contained Newton-solved cubic, no `kurbo` dep yet); still TODO: generalize `Track`→ typed `Property<T>`; auto-Bézier; anchor-point + separable position.
2. [ ] **GPU compositor** on the shared `prism-core` render graph; 18 blend modes; float buffers; linear-light. Retire the CPU solid-rect preview.
3. [~] **Graph Editor** — value-curve editor with draggable keys + per-key Bézier ease handles landed; **speed graph**, **roving keys**, and **auto-Bézier** still TODO.
4. [ ] **Layer types**: Adjustment + Null, then **footage** (`prism-media`) and **precomps** (Ph2).
5. [ ] Coordinate **`prism-fx`** (effects host), **`prism-media`** (FFmpeg, shared w/ Reel), and **`prism-vector`** (masks/shape layers, shared w/ Contour) promotions with the suite before building on them.

*Foundations are free. The product is the polish — and the glue between apps.*
